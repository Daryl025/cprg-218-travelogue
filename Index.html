                </header>
               <p>The library at <abbr title="Southern Alberta Institute of Technology"></abbr> is my go-to spot after classes. I often go there
                to unwind and catch up on my assignments. It a peaceful environment (depending on the hour)
                that allowa me to focus, be it solo or collaborating with classmates. The cozy study
                areas are well tailored for both individual sessions and group work. I also make new friends there
                discussing a wide variety of topics. Whether it's for a quick break or study session, the library is
                always my first pick.

          <h2>SAIT's GYM</h2>
           <p>SAIT's gym is an excellent place for staying fit and focused. After a long
            day of classes i often head over to the gym to clear my mind and work off any stress.
            Wide a wide range of equipment from cardio machines to free weights, it's 
            easy to find a machine that suits my fitness goals. In addition, there is usually an open court 
            where where students can play sports or just have fund with friends. Many clubs also use the court for their
            activities, creating a vibrant and engaging atmosphere . SAIT's gym is a great place to keep fit
